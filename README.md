<h1>READ BEFORE CLONING</h1>

<h2>Upon commiting</h2>
<p>When you are commiting changes make sure you add an informative commit message as to what changes you have made and what files were changed</p>
<p>This will reduce any confusion as to the workings of the application</p>
<p>If you are unsure as to what the changes mean, ask in the Discord group and tag the person that made the commit</p>
<p>If you didn't make the commit, but understand the changes, respond to the question</p>
<p>Since we only have < 20 days left, I ask that you respond to question about changes ASAP to ensure a proper workflow. If possible, respond within the same day the question was asked</p>
<p><em>I will try to clear up any confusion about changes made as best as I can understand the change's logic<em></p>

<hr>

<p>Before starting work on the project make sure you have the latest changes everyday</p>
<h5>To ensure you have the latest changes</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Head to the root directory of the project on your local machine</li>
  <li>git pull origin master</li>
  <li>Read commit messages to have a better understanding as to what was changed</li>
</ol>
